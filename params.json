Through the work, we consider few assumptions and constraints, closely related to the general exam scheduling problem, and mainly driven from accumulated experience at University of\r\nJordan. The performance of the algorithm is also a major concern of this project\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAhmed Jazzar (@ahmedaljazzar).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Palatable?
